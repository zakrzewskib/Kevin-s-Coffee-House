### About
* This project was started to practice HTML5 and CSS3 skills (only - no Javascript in this project).
* Kevin's Coffee House is a website based on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw">Kevin Powell's</a>
design shown on his 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq8LYj6kRyE">Give your site a fantastic color scheme fast</a> Youtube video.

* A lot of code is based on Udemy course that I finished:
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/">Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS</a> by
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/">Jonas Schmedtmann</a>.

* I used photos from https://unsplash.com/, https://www.pexels.com/ and https://www.vecteezy.com/.

### TO DO
* Add media queries - make website responsive (proper for tablets and phones).
* Add buttons to change color scheme.
